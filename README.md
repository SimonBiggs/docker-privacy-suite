# docker-privacy-suite
An attempt to collate a series of apps so that I can have a bit of my privacy back now that the Aussy government has made its suite of privacy removal laws.

Nothing much here yet but these are my aims:

 * Set up mumble and a mumble-server running through [torsocks](https://github.com/dgoulet/torsocks) [guide](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/Mumble), make use of [docker-mumble](https://github.com/overshard/docker-mumble).
 * Use [docker-desktop](https://github.com/rogaha/docker-desktop) so that the user can actually see the mumble gui
 * Install [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) with [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as the default search engine
 * Install [spideroak](https://spideroak.com/)
 * Install [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
 * Install [mailpile](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile)
 
Use docker fig to use [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/) instead of the default google dns.
